Code examples for interactive explanations of [[https://github.com/magit/transient][transient]].

This guide assumes you have minimal knowledge of Emacs, some programming
experience in elisp and non-lisp languages, and have at least seen [[https://magit.vc/screenshots/][screenshots]]
of =magit=.

* How to use

  There are two ways:

  - Open this file in Emacs and run examples as literate org.
  - Install the package to run commands and read their source.  Start with the
    =ts-showcase= command.

** Using as literate org document

  If you open this file in Emacs, it will switch to Org mode and you can run
  individual source blocks with =org-babel-execute-src-blk= on the block.

** Using as an installable package

  If you install the package, you can read source for each example with the
  normal.  =describe-function= command.  All commands are under =ts-*= prefix.
  Somewhat useful suffixes are under =ts-suffix-*= while less useful ones under
  =ts--suffix-*=.  They will come in handly when you are developing new
  applications.

  Installations for straight and elpaca:

  #+begin_src elisp

    ;; using straight use-package with custom recipe
    (straight-use-package
     '(transient-showcase
       :type git :host github :repo "positron-solutions/transient-showcase")
     :demand t)

    ;; using elpaca (recommended to add a hash for reproducibility)
    (elpaca-use-package
     (example :host github
              :repo "positron-solutions/transient-showcase")
     :demand t)

  #+end_src

  *Note* While this file is also the README for this repository, it's not
  intended to be used copy-paste.  Many links will only open in Emacs.  Some
  definitions are included by refrence from [[*Preludes][Preludes]]

** Packaging
   :PROPERTIES:
   :VISIBILITY: folded
   :END:

   This file is produced with =org-babel-tangle=.  Package header and preludes
   included in the no-web block below:

  #+begin_src elisp :tangle transient-showcase.el :noweb yes :hidden yes :eval never
    <<package-header>>
    <<wave-prelude>>
    <<predicates-prelude>>
    <<show-level-prelude>>
    <<levels-prelude>>
    <<print-args-prelude>>
  #+end_src

** Running Examples in Org Mode

   This is a basic transient, using an anonymous lambda interactive command as
   its only suffix.

  #+begin_src elisp :tangle transient-showcase.el

    (transient-define-prefix ts-hello ()
      "Prefix that is minimal and uses an anonymous command suffix."
      [("s" "call suffix"
        (lambda ()
          (interactive)
          (message "Called a suffix")))])

    ;; First, use M-x org-babel-execute-src-blk to cause `ts-hello' to be defined
    ;; Second, M-x `eval-last-sexp' with your point at the end of the line below
    ;; (ts-hello)

  #+end_src

  After executing the block above, you can =execute-extended-command= (*M-x*)
  and select =ts-hello= to show this transient.  All transient prefixes are also
  commands that show up in (*M-x*)

  *Note* If the example above is hard to read, review some [[info:elisp#Top][elisp]] [[*Essential Elisp][syntax]] and
  typical forms.

  Transient means temporary.  Transient gets it's name from the temporary keymap
  and the popup UI for displaying that keymap.  Emacs has a similar idea
  built-in with [[elisp:(describe-function 'set-transient-map)][set-transient-map]] for a temporary high-precedence keymap.

** Prefixes and Suffixes

   The hello transient user input sequence is:

  =Prefix -> Suffix=

  - The *prefix* is the command you invoke first, such as =magit-dispatch=
  - A *suffix* is a command displayed in the transient UI, such as
    =magit-stage=

    #+begin_src elisp :tangle no
      (magit-dispatch) ; same as pressing 'h' in magit-status buffer
    #+end_src

  The keymap and UI display is frequently referred to as "a transient".
  "Prefix" and "a transient" are almost the same thing.  Invoking a prefix will
  show a transient.  They are inseparable ideas.

*** Conceptual similarity to Emacs prefix arguments

    *Setting [[https://emacsdocs.org/docs/emacs/Prefix-Keymaps][prefix arguments]] with =universal-argument= (=C-u=) is a distinct,
    separate behavior that is part of Emacs.*

    With prefix arguments, you "call" commands with extra arguments, like you
    would a function.

    A transient prefix can set some states and its suffix can then use these
    states to tweak its behavior.  The difference is that within the lifecycle
    of a transient UI, and coordinating with transient's state persistence, you
    can create much more complex input to your commands.  You can use commands
    to construct phrases for other commands.

    To see a short example of prefix arguments being used within a transient
    prefix, see [[*Scope][the scope example]].


** Nesting Prefixes

  A prefix can also be bound as a suffix, enabling /nested/ prefixes.  A user
  input sequence with nested transients might look like:

  =Prefix -> Sub-Prefix -> Sub-Prefix -> Suffix=

  For example, in the =magit-dispatch= transient (=?=), =l= for =magit-log= is
  a nested transient. =b= for =all branches= is the suffix command
  =magit-log-all-branches=.

  See [[*Flow Control][Flow Control]] for nested transient examples with both sub-prefixes and
  suffixes that do no exit.

** Infix

  Some suffixes need to hold state, toggling or storing an argument.  Infixes
  are specialized suffixes to set and hold state.  A user input sequence with
  infixes:

  =Prefix -> Infix -> Infix -> Suffix=

  See [[*Basic Infixes][Infix examples]] to get a better idea.

** Summary

  - *Prefixes* display the pop-up UI and bind the keymap.
  - *Suffixes* are commands bound within a prefix
  - *Infixes* are a specialized suffix for storing and setting state
  - A *Suffix* may be yet another *Prefix*, in which case the transient is
    nested

  You can declare the same behavior 3-4 ways

  - Shorthand forms within =transient-define-prefix= macro allow shorthand
    binding of suffixes & commands or creation of infixes directly within the
    layout definition.

  - Macros for suffixes and infix definition streamline defining commands while
    also defining how they will behave in a layout.

  - Keyword arguments ~(:foo val1 :bar val2)~ are interpreted by the macros and
    used to set slots (OOP attributes) on prefix, group, and suffix objects.
    Similar forms for declaring suffixes can be used to modify them when
    declaring a layout.  Very specific control over layouts also uses these
    forms.

    #+begin_src elisp :tangle no
      ;; slots & methods that can be set / overridden in children
      (describe-function transient-child)
    #+end_src

  - Custom classes using EIEIO (basically elisp OOP) can change methods deeper
    in the implementation than you can reach with slots.  =describe-function= is
    a quick way to look at the methods.

    #+begin_src elisp :tangle no
      ;; slots & methods that can be set / overridden in suffixes
      (describe-function transient-suffix)
    #+end_src

    See the [[*EIEIO - OOP in Elisp][EIEIO Appendix]] for introduction to exploring EIEIO objects and
    classes.

** The Shorthand form

   Binding suffixes with the =("key" "description" suffix-or-command)= form
   within a group is extremely common.

   #+begin_src elisp :tangle no :var _=wave-prelude

     (transient-define-prefix ts-wave ()
       "Prefix that waves at the user"
       [("w" "wave" ts-suffix-wave)]) ; ts-suffix-wave is a simple command from wave-prelude

     ;; (ts-wave)

   #+end_src

   *Note:* Both commands and suffixes from =transient-define-suffix= can be
   used.  It's a good reason to use =private--namespace= style names for suffix
   actions since these commands don't usually show up in (*M-x*) by default.

** Keyword Arguments Style

   You can customize the slot value (OOP attribute) of the transient, groups,
   and suffixes by adding extra ~:foo value~ style pairs.

   Not all behaviors have a shorthand form, so as you use more behaviors, you
   will see more of the keyword argument style API.  Here we use the
   =:transient= property, set to true, meaning the suffix won't exit the
   transient.

   #+begin_src elisp :tangle no :var _=levels-prelude

     (transient-define-prefix ts-wave-keyword-args ()
       "Prefix that waves at the user persistently."
       [("e" "wave eventually & stay" ts--wave-eventually :transient t)
        ("s" "wave surely & leave" ts--wave-surely :transient nil)])

     ;; (ts-wave-keyword-args)

   #+end_src

   Launch the command, wave several times (note timestamp update) and then exit
   with (*C-g*).

** Macro Child Definition Style

   The =transient-define-suffix= macro can help if you need to bind a command in
   multiple places and only override some properties for some prefixes.  It
   makes the prefix definition more compact at the expense of a more verbose
   command.

   #+name: ts-wave-suffix-def
   #+begin_src elisp :tangle transient-showcase.el

     (transient-define-suffix ts-suffix-wave-macroed ()
       "Prefix that waves with macro-defined suffix."
       :transient t
       :key "T"
       :description "wave from macro definition"
       (interactive)
       (message "Waves from a macro definition at: %s" (current-time-string)))

   #+end_src

   #+begin_src elisp :tangle transient-showcase.el :var _=ts-wave-suffix-def
     ;; ts-suffix-wave-suffix defined above

     (transient-define-prefix ts-wave-macro-defined ()
       "Prefix to wave using a macro-defined suffix"
       [(ts-suffix-wave-macroed)]) ; note, information moved from prefix to the suffix.

     ;; (ts-wave-macro-defined)

   #+end_src

** Overriding slots in the prefix definition

   Even if you define a property via one of the macros, you can still override
   that property in the later prefix definition.  The example below overrides
   the =:transient=, =:description=, and =:key= properties of the
   =ts-suffix-wave= suffix defined above:

   #+name: ts-wave-overridden
   #+begin_src elisp :tangle transient-showcase.el :var _=ts-wave-suffix-def

     (defun ts--wave-override ()
       "Vanilla command used to override suffix's commands."
       (interactive)
       (message "This suffix was overridden.  I am what remains."))

     (transient-define-prefix ts-wave-overridden ()
       "Prefix that waves with overridden suffix behavior"
       [(ts-suffix-wave-macroed
         :transient nil
         :key "O"
         :description "wave overridingly"
         :command ts--wave-override)]) ; we overrode what the suffix even does

     ;; (ts-wave-overridden)

   #+end_src

   If you just list the key and symbol followed by properties, it is also
   a supported shorthand suffix form:

   =("wf" ts-suffix-wave :description "wave furiously")=

** Quoting Note for Vectors

   Inside the =[ ...vectors... ]= in =transient-define-prefix=, you don't need
   to quote symbols because in the vector, everything is a literal.  When you
   move a shorthand style =:property symbol= out to the
   =transient-define-suffix= form, which is a list, you might need to quote the
   symbol as =:property 'symbol=.

   To define a transient, you need at least one group.  Groups are
   vectors, delimited as =[ ...group... ]=.

   There is basic layout support and you can use it to collect or differentiate
   commands.

   If you begin a group vector with a string, you get a group heading.  Groups
   also support some [[https://magit.vc/manual/transient/Group-Specifications.html#Group-Specifications][properties]].  The [[elisp:(describe-function transient-group)][group class]] also has a lot of information.

** Descriptions

   Very straightforward.  Just make the first element in the vector a string or
   add a =:description= property, which can be a function.

   In the prefix definition of suffixes, the second string is a description.

   The =:description= key is applied last and therefore wins in ambiguous
   declarations.

   #+begin_src elisp :tangle transient-showcase.el :var _=wave-prelude

     (transient-define-prefix ts-layout-descriptions ()
       "Prefix with descriptions specified with slots."
       ["Let's Give This Transient a Title\n" ; yes the newline works
        ["Group One"
         ("wo" "wave once" ts-suffix-wave)
         ("wa" "wave again" ts-suffix-wave)]

        ["Group Two"
         ("ws" "wave some" ts-suffix-wave)
         ("wb" "wave better" ts-suffix-wave)]]

       ["Bad title" :description "Group of Groups"
        ["Group Three"
         ("k" "bad desc" ts-suffix-wave :description "key-value wins")
         ("n" ts-suffix-wave :description "no desc necessary")]
        [:description "Key Only Def"
         ("wt" "wave too much" ts-suffix-wave)
         ("we" "wave excessively" ts-suffix-wave)]])

     ;; (ts-layout-descriptions)

   #+end_src

*** Dynamic Descriptions

   *Note:* The property list style for dynamic descriptions is the same for both
   prefixes and suffixes.  Add =:description symbol-or-lambda-form= to the group
   vector or suffix list.

   #+begin_src elisp :tangle transient-showcase.el :var _=wave-prelude

      (transient-define-prefix ts-layout-dynamic-descriptions ()
        "Prefix that generate descriptions dynamically when transient is shown."
        ;; group using function-name to generate description
        [:description current-time-string
         ;; single suffix with dynamic description
         ("wa" ts-suffix-wave
          :description (lambda ()
                         (format "Wave at %s" (current-time-string))))]
        ;; group with anonymoous function generating description
        [:description (lambda ()
                        (format "Group %s" (org-id-new)))
                      ("wu" "wave uniquely" ts-suffix-wave)])

    凸( ` ﾛ ´ )凸

** Layouts

   The default behavior treats groups a little differently depending on how they
   are nested.  For most simple groupings, this is sufficient control.

*** Groups one on top of the other

    Use a vector for each row.

   #+begin_src elisp :tangle transient-showcase.el :var _=wave-prelude

     (transient-define-prefix ts-layout-stacked ()
       "Prefix with layout that stacks groups on top of each other."
       ["Top Group" ("wt" "wave top" ts-suffix-wave)]
       ["Bottom Group" ("wb" "wave bottom" ts-suffix-wave)])

     ;; (ts-layout-stacked)

   #+end_src

*** Groups side by side

    Use a vector of vectors for columns.

   #+begin_src elisp :tangle transient-showcase.el :var _=wave-prelude

     (transient-define-prefix ts-layout-columns ()
       "Prefix with side-by-side layout."
       [["Left Group" ("wl" "wave left" ts-suffix-wave)]
        ["Right Group" ("wr" "wave right" ts-suffix-wave)]])

     ;; (ts-layout-columns)

   #+end_src

*** Group on top of groups side by side

    Vector on top of vector inside a vector.

   #+begin_src elisp :tangle transient-showcase.el :var _=wave-prelude

     (transient-define-prefix ts-layout-stacked-columns ()
       "Prefix with stacked columns layout."
       ["Top Group"
        ("wt" "wave top" ts-suffix-wave)]

       [["Left Group"
         ("wl" "wave left" ts-suffix-wave)]
        ["Right Group"
         ("wr" "wave right" ts-suffix-wave)]])

     ;; (ts-layout-stacked-columns)

   #+end_src

   *Note: Groups can have groups or suffixes, but not both.  You can't mix
   suffixes alongside groups in the same vector.  The resulting transient will
   error when invoked.*

*** Empty strings make spaces

    Groups that are empty or only space have no effect.  This situation can
    happen with layouts that update dynamically.  See [[*dynamic layouts][dynamic layouts]].

   #+begin_src elisp :tangle transient-showcase.el :var _=wave-prelude

     (transient-define-prefix ts-layout-spaced-out ()
       "Prefix lots of spacing for users to space out at."
       ["" ; cannot add another empty string because it will mix suffixes with groups
        ["Left Group"
         ""
         ("wl" "wave left" ts-suffix-wave)
         ("L" "wave lefter" ts-suffix-wave)
         ""
         ("bl" "wave bottom-left" ts-suffix-wave)
         ("z" "zone\n" zone)] ; the newline does pad

        [[]] ; empty vector will do nothing

        [""] ; vector with just empty line has no effect

        ;; empty group will be ignored
        ;; (useful for hiding in dynamic layouts)
        ["Empty Group\n"]

        ["Right Group"
         ""
         ("wr" "wave right" ts-suffix-wave)
         ("R" "wave righter" ts-suffix-wave)
         ""
         ("br" "wave bottom-right" ts-suffix-wave)]])

     ;; (ts-layout-spaced-out)

   #+end_src

*** A Grid

    So, you put columns into rows that are in columns and stuff like that.  This
    can be achieved with or without explicit column settings.

    #+begin_src elisp :tangle transient-showcase.el :var _=wave-prelude

      (transient-define-prefix ts-layout-the-grid ()
        "Prefix with groups in a grid-like arrangement."

        [:description "The Grid\n" ; must use slot or macro is confused
         ["Left Column" ; note, no newline
          ("ltt" "left top top" ts-suffix-wave)
          ("ltb" "left top bottom" ts-suffix-wave)
          ""
          ("lbt" "left bottom top" ts-suffix-wave)
          ("lbb" "left bottom bottom" ts-suffix-wave)] ; note, no newline

         ["Right Column\n"
          ("rtt" "right top top" ts-suffix-wave)
          ("rtb" "right top bottom" ts-suffix-wave)
          ""
          ("rbt" "right bottom top" ts-suffix-wave)
          ("rbb" "right bottom bottom\n" ts-suffix-wave)]])

      ;; (ts-layout-the-grid)

    #+end_src

    *Note*, only =transient-columns=, not =transient-column= can act as a group
    of groups.

** Manually setting group class

   If you need to override the class that the =transient-define-prefix= macro
   would normally use.

   #+begin_src elisp :tangle transient-showcase.el :var _=wave-prelude

     (transient-define-prefix ts-layout-explicit-classes ()
       "Prefix with group class used to explicitly specify layout."
       [:class transient-row "Row"
               ("l" "wave left" ts-suffix-wave)
               ("r" "wave right" ts-suffix-wave)]
       [:class transient-column "Column"
               ("t" "wave top" ts-suffix-wave)
               ("b" "wave bottom" ts-suffix-wave)])

  Many transients call other transients.  This allows you to express similar
  behaviors as interactive commands that ask you for multiple arguments using
  the minibuffer.

  Transient has more options for retaining some state across several transients,
  making it easier to compose commands and to retain intermediate states for
  rapidly achieving series of actions over similar inputs.

** Single versus multiple commands

   Sometimes you want to execute multiple commands without re-opening the
   transient.  It's the same idea as [[https://github.com/emacsorphanage/god-mode][god mode]] or Evil repeat.

       "Prefix where some suffixes do not exit."
       ["Exit or Not?"

        ;; this suffix will not exit after calling sub-prefix
        ("we" "wave & exit" ts-wave-overridden)
        ("ws" "wave & stay" ts-wave :transient t)])

     ;; (ts-stay-transient)

   #+end_src

   *Note*, if =ts-wave= was used in both exit & stay, the =:transient= slot
   would be clobbered and we would only get one behavior.  Beware of re-using
   the same object instances in the same layout.  Move the =:transient= slot
   override between the two suffixes to see the change in behavior.

** Nesting

   Nesting is putting transients inside other transients, creating user-input
   sequences like:

   =Prefix -> Sub-Prefix -> Suffix=

*** Binding a Sub-Prefix

    This is the most simple way to create nesting.

    #+name: simple-parent-child
    #+begin_src elisp :tangle transient-showcase.el :var _=wave-prelude

      (transient-define-prefix ts--simple-child ()
        ["Simple Child"
         ("wc" "wave childishly" ts-suffix-wave)])

      (transient-define-prefix ts-simple-parent ()
        "Prefix that calls a child prefix."
        ["Simple Parent"
         ("w" "wave parentally" ts-suffix-wave)
         ("b" "become child" ts--simple-child)])

      ;; (ts--simple-child)
      ;; (ts-simple-parent)

    #+end_src

**** Nesting with multiple commands

     Declaring a nested prefix that "returns" to its parent has a convenient
     shorthand form.

    #+begin_src elisp :tangle transient-showcase.el :var _=wave-prelude __=simple-parent-child

      (transient-define-prefix ts-simple-parent-with-return ()
        "Prefix with a child prefix that returns."
        ["Parent With Return"
         ("w" "wave parentally" ts-suffix-wave)
         ("b" "become child with return" ts--simple-child :transient t)])

      ;; Child does not "return" when called independently
      ;; (ts--simple-child)
      ;; (ts-simple-parent-with-return)

    #+end_src

*** Setting up another transient manually

    If you call =(transient-setup 'transient-command-symbol)=, you will activate
    a replacement transient.

    This form is useful if you want a command to /perhaps/ load yet another
    transient in some situation.  You may even just want to load the same
    transient with different context, such as passing in a new [[*Scope][scope]].

    #+begin_src elisp :tangle transient-showcase.el :var _=simple-parent-child __=wave-prelude

      (transient-define-suffix ts-suffix-setup-child ()
        "A suffix that uses `transient-setup' to manually load another transient."
        (interactive)
        ;; note that it's usually during the post-command side of calling the
        ;; command that the actual work to set up the transient will occur.
        ;; This is an implementation detail because it depends if we are calling
        ;; `transient-setup' while already transient or not.
        (transient-setup 'ts--simple-child))

      (transient-define-prefix ts-parent-with-setup-suffix ()
        "Prefix with a suffix that calls `transient-setup'."
        ["Simple Parent"
         ("wp" "wave parentally" ts-suffix-wave :transient t) ; remain transient

         ;; You may need to specify a different pre-command (the :transient) key
         ;; because we need to clean up this transient or create some conditions
         ;; to trigger the following transient correctly.  This example will
         ;; work with `transient--do-replace' or no custom pre-command

         ("bc" "become child" ts-suffix-setup-child :transient transient--do-replace)])

      ;; (ts-parent-with-setup-suffix)

    #+end_src

**** TODO Errata
     :PROPERTIES:
     :ID:       e6f2ba1b-b67e-4bde-8aaf-d3decba915c4
     :TOC: :ignore this
     :END:

     This example should also work with the =transient--do-recurse= pre-command,
     but the child transient does not return.  There is a difference in the
     behavior that should not depend on if the suffix /is/ the prefix or just sets
     up the prefix.  *Possible bug*.

** Mixing Interactive

   You can mix normal Emacs completion flows with transient UI's.

   See [[info:elisp#Interactive Codes][Interactive codes]] are listed in the Elisp manual.

   *Note*, this also works when binding existing commands that recieve user
   input.

   #+begin_src elisp :tangle transient-showcase.el

     (transient-define-suffix ts--suffix-interactive-string (user-input)
       "An interactive suffix that obtains string input from the user."
       (interactive "sPlease just tell me what you want!: ")
       (message "I think you want: %s" user-input))

     (transient-define-suffix ts--suffix-interactive-buffer-name (buffer-name)
       "An interactive suffix that obtains a buffer name from the user."
       (interactive "b")
       (message "You selected: %s" buffer-name))

     (transient-define-prefix ts-interactive-basic ()
       "Prefix with interactive user input."
       ["Interactive Command Suffixes"
        ("s" "enter string" ts--suffix-interactive-string)
        ("b" "select buffer" ts--suffix-interactive-buffer-name)])

     ;; (ts-interactive-basic)

   #+end_src

*** Early return

    Sometimes you can complete your work without asking the user for more input.
    In the custom body for a prefix, if you decline to call =transient-setup=,
    then the command will just exit with no problems.

    Below is a nested transient.

    - The body form of the nested child can return early without loading a new transient
    - The parent uses =transient--do-recurse= to make it's child "return" to it
    - The "radiations" command in the child explicitly overrides this, using
      =transient--do-exit= so that it /does not/ return to the parent

    #+begin_src elisp :tangle true

      (defvar ts--complex nil "Show complex menu or not")

      (transient-define-suffix ts--toggle-complex ()
        :transient t
        :description (lambda () (format "toggle complex: %s" ts--complex))
        (interactive)
        (setf ts--complex (not ts--complex))
        (message (propertize (concat "Complexity set to: "
                                     (if ts--complex "true" "false"))
                             'face 'success)))

      (transient-define-prefix ts-complex-messager ()
        "Prefix that sends complex messages, unles `ts--complex' is nil."
        ["Send Complex Messages"
         ("s" "snow people"
          (lambda () (interactive)
            (message (propertize "snow people! ☃" 'face 'success))))
         ("k" "kitty cats"
          (lambda () (interactive)
            (message (propertize "🐈 kitty cats! 🐈" 'face 'success))))
         ("r" "radiations"
          (lambda () (interactive)
            (message (propertize "Oh no! radiation! ☢" 'face 'success)))
          ;; radiation is dangerous!
          :transient transient--do-exit)]

        (interactive)
        ;; The command body either sets up the transient or simply returns
        ;; This is the "early return" we're talking about.
        (if ts--complex
            (transient-setup 'ts-complex-messager)
          (message "Simple and boring!")))

      (transient-define-prefix ts-simple-messager ()

        [["Send Message"
          ;; using `transient--do-recurse' causes suffixes in ts-child to perform
          ;; `transient--do-return' so that we come back to this transient.

          ("t" ts--toggle-complex)]])

      ;; does not "return" when called independently
      ;; (ts-complex-messager)

** Pre-Commands Explained
   :PROPERTIES:
   :ID:       0c106a1b-d824-4321-89a5-b1e06b468c63
   :END:

   The value in the =:transient= slot affects what state the body of your
   command will see and what will happen after your command, during the
   post-command.

   The =:transient= slot holds a function called the "pre-command."  Before your
   suffix body forms run, the pre-command is called and creates the conditions
   that your suffix may use to, for example, prepare for reading variables that
   were set on infixes.  If the pre-command calls =transient-export= then it
   will add to history.

   In =transient-define-prefix= and =transient-define-suffix=, the =t= value is
   actually translated to =transient--do-call= or =transient--do-recurse=
   depending on the situation.

   These functions set up some states so that post-command can figure out if it
   needs to exit, save values, or enter another transient, and what else to do
   while entering that new transient.

   The [[https://magit.vc/manual/transient.html#Transient-State][official long manual]] has some more detail.  These examples should prepare
   you to visualize the forms used in those explanations.

*** Warning!

    Some of the *trickiest bugs you can introduce* will happen when using the
    following variables and functions at varying points in command lifecycles:

    - =transient-current-command=
    - =transient--command=
    - =transient-current-prefix=
    - =transient--prefix=
    - =transient-args=

    During the pre-command and post-command, these can change.  When you are
    overriding the pre-command, you may discover things such as the result of
    =transient-args= changing.  Calling =transient-setup= may update things.
    Even if you call =transient-args= on on the specific transient, the results
    change during the lifecycle and depending on the pre-command.

    *In particular* it seems like layout predicates should use
    =transient--prefix= while suffix bodies should use
    =transient-current-prefix=.

    Not all pre-commands are compatible with all situations and suffixes!

  There are several ways to create state.  The [[*Nesting & Flow Control][flow control]] examples in the
  previous section mainly covered how to get from one command to the other.
  This section covers how to save values and then read them later, sometimes
  from a completely different transient.  *Coupled with [[*Custom Infix Types][custom infix types]], you
  can create some seriously rich user expression.*

  To spark your imagination, here's a non-exhaustive list of how to get data
  into your commands:

  - Interactive forms
  - Prefix arguments (=C-u= universal argument)
  - Setting the scope in =transient-setup=
  - Obtaining a scope in a custom =transient-init-scope= method
  - Default values in prefix definition
  - Saved values of infixes
  - Saved values in other infixes / prefixs with shared =history-key=
  - User-set infix values from the current or parent prefix
  - Ad-hoc values in regular =defvar= and =defcustom= etc
  - Reading values from another, perhaps distant prefix
  - Arguments passed into interactive commands to call them as normal elisp
    functions

** The Magic of Transient

   Using all of these mechanisms, you can enable users to rapidly construct
   complex command sentences, sentences with phrases.  You can basically make a
   user interface as expressive as elisp.

   A user input sequence like this:

   =Prefix -> Interactive -> Sub-Prefix -> Infix -> Suffix -> Suffix -> ...=

   Is basically the same as doing this in elisp:

   #+begin_src elisp :tangle no :eval never

     (let ((input (Sub-Prefix (Prefix) (Interactive)))
           (infix (Infix))
       (suffix input infix)
       (suffix input infix)))

   #+end_src

   With history, you can remember lots of these states.  This allows the user to
   quickly fire off lots of mostly completed partial expressions.  They are
   scoped, so you can keep state over different contexts.

   This is what is meant by "creating user interfaces as expressive as elisp."

   Because interactive forms and transients are both still just consuming linear
   user input, they ultimately have the same capabilities, but if you /think/ in
   terms of partially constructed elisp expressions, you can do more than if the
   user has to enter in contextless commands over and over or write more
   commands while managing their own state in ad-hoc fashion.

   Transient's UI also provides greater awareness to the user of the current
   state.  This makes it easier for the user to achieve the greater complexity
   that is intended, without remembering the command language you are designing
   for your application.

** Infixes

   Functions need arguments.  Infixes are specialized suffixes with behavior
   defaults that make sense for setting and storing values for consumption in
   suffixes.  It's like passing arguments into the suffix.  They also have
   support for persisting state across invocations and Emacs sessions.

*** Basic Infixes

    Infix classes built-in all descend from =transient-infix= and can be seen
    clearly in the =eieio-browse=.  View their slots and documentaiton with
    ~(describe-class transient-infix)~ etc.  Here you can see what most infixes
    look like and how they behave.

   #+begin_src elisp :tangle transient-showcase.el :var  _=print-args-prelude

     ;; infix defined with a macro
     (transient-define-argument ts--exclusive-switches ()
       "This is a specialized infix for only selecting one of several values."
       :class 'transient-switches
       :argument-format "--%s-snowcone"
       :argument-regexp "\\(--\\(grape\\|orange\\|cherry\\|lime\\)-snowcone\\)"
       :choices '("grape" "orange" "cherry" "lime"))

     (transient-define-prefix ts-basic-infixes ()
       "Prefix that just shows off many typical infix types."
       ["Infixes"

        ;; from macro
        ("-e" "exclusive switches" ts--exclusive-switches)

        ;; shorthand definitions

        ("-s" "switch" "--switch")
        ( "n" "no dash switch" "still works")
        ("-a" "argument" "--argument=" :prompt "Let's argue because: ")

        ;; a bit of inline EIEIO in our shorthand
        ("-n" "never empty" "--non-null=" :always-read t
         :init-value (lambda (obj) (oset obj value "better-than-nothing")))

        ("-c" "choices" "--choice=" :choices (foo bar baz))]

       ["Show Args"
        ("s" "show arguments" ts-suffix-print-args)])

     ;; (ts-basic-infixes)

   #+end_src

*** Reading Infix Values

   *Reminder* in the section on [[*Pre-Commands Explained][pre-commands]] the discussion about the
    =:transient= mentions that the values available in a suffix body depend on
    whe ther the pre-command called =transient--export= before evaluating the
    suffix body.

    There are two basic ways to read infixes:

    - =(transient-args transient-current-command)= and parse manually
    - =(transient-arg-value "--argument-" (transient-args transient-current-command)=
    - =(transient-suffixes transient-current-command)= and retrieve your fully
      hydrated suffix

**** TODO The =transient-suffixes= option requires filtering
     :PROPERTIES:
     :TOC: :ignore this
     :END:

     In my opinion the API should make it easer to get raw values from suffixes,
     but this is also a matter of custom infixes needing to serialize values
     correctly so that =transient-arg-value= will "just work".

** Scope

   When you call a function with an argument, you want to know in the body of
   your function what that argument was.  This is the scope.  The prefix is
   initialized with the =:scope= either in it's own body or a similar form.
   Suffixes can then read back that scope in their body.  The suffix object is
   given the scope and can use it to alter its own display or behavior.  The
   layout also can interpret the scope while it is initializing.

   *WARNING* When writing predicates against the scope, you will need to
   determine whether =transient--prefix= or =transient-current-prefix= is
   correct when writing prefix-generic suffixes.  It is very subtle if you
   accidentally choose the wrong one and the parent has a nil scope while the
   child has an entirely different scope.  These variables change throughout the
   lifecycle!  Use [[*Watching evaluation in Edebug][edebug]] you must!

    *Possibly a bug in transient.*

** Prefix Value & History

   Briefly, there are three locations for state you need to be aware of for this
   section:

   - Each transient's prefix object has a =:value= that is updated by
     =transient-set= and =transient-save=
   - The values obtained from =transient-args= are usually quite ephemeral and
     don't even persist beyond the body of form of the suffixes you usually read
     them in
   - =transient-values= contains saved values that are used to rehydrate the
     prefix =:value= slot when the prefix is created
   - =transient-history= is used to make it faster for the user to flip through
     previous states (which can have independent histories for infixes and
     prefixes).  These are never used unless calling =transient-history-prev=
     and =transient-history-next=.

   We can get this as a list of strings for any prefix by calling
   =transient-args= on =transient-current-command= in the suffix's interactive
   form.  If you know the command you want the value of, you can use it's symbol
   instead of =transient-current-command=.

  This is related to history keys.  If you set the arguments and then save them
  using (=C-x s=) for the command =transient-save=, not only will the transient
  be updated with the new value, but if you call the child independently, it can
  still read the value from the suffix.

  It's worth bringing up the [[elisp:(describe-variable 'transient-show-common-commands)][=transient-show-common-commands=]] variable. *You may
  want to set this when working on the history support for your transients.*
  Otherwise, just remember the (=C-x=) menu inside transients.

** History Keys

   History lets you *set* infixes using prior values.  It's per-prefix,
   per-suffix usually.  Using previous examples like =ts-snowcone-eater=, you
   can flip through history using:

   - =C-x p= for =transient-history-prev=
   - =C-x n= for =transient-history-next=

   These bindings are revealed when =transient-show-common-commands= is =t= or
   when you hit the =C-x= prefix.

   However, what if you *don't* want a unique history for some infixes or even
   prefixes?

   *Note* As a more advanced example, using EIEIO and dynamic layout techniques
   to modify the slot of =:history-key=, you can also make unique histories for
   the same prefix/infix by setting that slot value depending on the context you
   want unique histories for.

   The following example can demonstrate the behavior with some user effort:

  #+name: ts-ping-example
  #+begin_src elisp :tangle transient-showcase.el :var _=print-args-prelude

    (transient-define-prefix ts-ping ()
      "Prefix demonstrating history sharing."

      :history-key 'non-unique-name

      ["Ping"
       ("-g" "game" "--game=")
       ("p" "ping the pong" ts-pong)
       ("a" "print args" ts-suffix-print-args :transient nil)])

    (transient-define-prefix ts-pong ()
      "Prefix demonstrating history sharing."

      :history-key 'non-unique-name

      ["Pong"
       ("-g" "game" "--game=")
       ("p" "pong the ping" ts-ping)
       ("a" "print args" ts-suffix-print-args :transient nil)])

    ;; (ts-ping)
    ;; Okay here's where it gets weird
    ;; 1.  Set the value of game to something and remember it
    ;; 2.  Press a to print the args
    ;; 3.  Re-open ts-ping.
    ;; 4.  C-x p to load the previous history, see the old value?
    ;; 5.  p to switch to the ts-pong transient
    ;; 6.  C-x p to load the previous history, see the old value from ts-ping???
    ;; 7. Note that ts-pong uses the same history as ts-ping!

*** Detangling with Initialization, Setting, and Saving
    :PROPERTIES:
    :ID:       6f6c8eba-1c0e-41c4-b57f-c06ab00f64d1
    :END:

    Set values show up in the prefix's =value= slot.

    #+begin_src elisp :tangle no :var _=ts-ping-example

      (oref (plist-get (symbol-plist 'ts-ping) 'transient--prefix) value)

    #+end_src

    The prefix value will get the last value that was *set* using
    =transient-set=.

    However, the prefix value shown in =transient-values= is only updated when
    calling =transient-save=.

    Saved values show up in =transient-values=.  If you save =ts-ping=, you can
    see the saved value here:

    #+begin_src elisp :tangle no :var _=ts-ping-example

      (assoc 'ts-ping transient-values)

    #+end_src

    *These two values may be independent.* They are written at the same time
    when calling =transient-save=.  During prefix initializaton, the =:value= is
    written from =transient-values=.

    Play with the =ts-snowcone-eater= and =ts-ping= and =ts-pong= in the =C-x=
    menu while also looking at what gets stored in =transient-values=,
    =transient-history= and the prefix's slots.

    When you re-evaluate the prefix or reload Emacs, you will see the result of
    initialization from =transient-values=.

** Disabling Set / Save on a Suffix

   To disable saving and setting values, causing a prefix to always end up using
   the default value, set the =:unsavable= slot to =t=.

   #+begin_src elisp :tangle transient-showcase.el :var _=print-args-prelude

     (transient-define-prefix ts-goldfish ()
       "A prefix that cannot remember anything."
       ["Goldfish"
        ("-r" "rememeber" "--i-remember="
         :unsavable t ; infix isn't saved
         :always-read t ; infix always asks for new value
         ;; overriding the method to provide a starting value
         :init-value (lambda (obj) (oset obj value "nothing")))
        ("a" "print args" ts-suffix-print-args :transient nil)])

     ;; (ts-goldfish)

   #+end_src

   Try to update =remember= and then set and save it in the =C-x= menu.  Reload
   it.  It will never pay attention to history or setting & saving the transient
   value.

** Setting or Saving Every Time a Suffix is Used

   #+begin_src elisp :tangle transient-showcase.el :var _=print-args-prelude

     (transient-define-suffix ts-suffix-remember-and-wave ()
       "Wave, and force the prefix to set it's saveable infix values."
       (interactive)

       ;; (transient-reset) ; forget
       (transient-set) ; save for this session
       ;; If you combine reset with set, you get a reset for future sessions only.
       ;; (transient-save) ; save for this and future sessions
       ;; (transient-reset-value some-other-prefix-object)

       (message "Waves at user at: %s.  You will never be forgotten." (current-time-string)))

     (transient-define-prefix ts-elephant ()
       "A prefix that always remembers its infixes."
       ["Elephant"
        ("-r" "rememeber" "--i-remember="
         :always-read t)
        ("w" "remember and wave" ts-suffix-remember-and-wave)
        ("a" "print args (skips remembering)" ts-suffix-print-args :transient nil)])

     ;; (ts-elephant)

   #+end_src

*** TODO Sticky infix support

    There needs to be a slot that causes infixes to always be set on export.
    This would cover cases where the most frequent user input changes just
    rapidly enough that both setting every time and saving are equally
    inconvenient.  Using =transient-set= is kind of brute-ish.

*** Default Values

    Every transient prefix has a value.  It's a list.  You can set it to create
    defaults for switches and arguments.

   #+begin_src elisp :tangle transient-showcase.el :var _=print-args-prelude

     (transient-define-prefix ts-default-values ()
       "A prefix with a default value."

       :value '("--toggle" "--value=5")

       ["Arguments"
        ("t" "toggle" "--toggle")
        ("v" "value" "--value=" :prompt "an integer: ")]

       ["Show Args"
        ("s" "show arguments" ts-suffix-print-args)])

     ;; (ts-default-values)

   #+end_src

   *Note*, after setting or saving a value on this transient using the =C-x=
   menu, the next time the transient is set up, it will have a different
   value. If you want the default to return, use =transient-reset= in your
   suffix.

*** Readers

    Readers are the mechanism to provide completions and to enforce input
    validity of infixes.

   #+begin_src elisp :tangle transient-showcase.el :var _=print-args-prelude

     (transient-define-prefix ts-enforcing-inputs ()
       "A prefix with enforced input type."

       ["Arguments"
        ("v" "value" "--value=" :prompt "an integer: " :reader transient-read-number-N+)]

       ["Show Args"
        ("s" "show arguments" ts-suffix-print-args)])

     ;; (ts-enforcing-inputs)

   #+end_src

   Setting the reader can be used to enforce rules of valid input.  See
   [[id:0c3f2271-98e0-4db4-b95b-e31975bcbb5e][Advanced/Custom Infix Types]] for an example of writing a custom reader that
   validates input and assigning that reader via the class method instead of the
   =:reader= slot.

** Lisp Variables

   Lisp variables are currently at an experimental support level.  They way they
   work is to report and set the value of a lisp symbol variable.  Because they
   aren't necessarilly intended to be printed as crude CLI arguments, they *DO
   NOT* appear in =(transient-args 'prefix)= but this is fine because you can
   just use the variable.

   Customizing this class can be useful when working with objects and functions
   that exist entirely in elisp.

   #+begin_src elisp :tangle transient-showcase.el :var _=wave-prelude

     (defvar ts--position '(0 0) "A transient prefix location")

       (transient-define-infix ts--pos-infix ()
         "A location, key, or command symbol"
         :class 'transient-lisp-variable
         :transient t
         :prompt "An expression such as (0 0), \"p\", nil, 'ts--msg-pos: "
         :variable 'ts--position)

       (transient-define-suffix ts--msg-pos ()
         "Message the element at location"
         :transient 'transient--do-call
         (interactive)
         ;; lisp variables are not sent in the usual (transient-args) list.
         ;; Just read `ts--position' directly.
         (let ((suffix (transient-get-suffix transient-current-command ts--position)))
           (message "%s" (oref suffix description))))

       (transient-define-prefix ts-lisp-variable ()
         "A prefix that updates and uses a lisp variable."
         ["Location Printing"
          [("p" "position" ts--pos-infix)]
          [("m" "message" ts--msg-pos)]])

  This section covers more usages of infixes, focused on creating better
  argument strings for CLI tools.

  The section on [[*Flow control & managing state][flow control & managing state]] has more information about
  controlling elisp applications.

** Reading arguments within suffixes

   *Note:* these forms are generic for different prefixes, allowing you to mix
   and match suffixes within prefixes.

** Switches & Arguments Again

   The shorthand forms in =transient-define-prefix= are heavily influenced by
   the CLI style switches and arguments that transient was built to
   control. Most shorthand forms look like so:

   =("key" "description" "argument")=

   The macro will select the infix's exact class depending on how you write
   =:argument=.  If you write something ending in ~=~ such as ~--value=~ then
   you get =:class transient-option= but if not, the default is a =:class
   transient-switch=

   Use [[elisp:(describe-function transient-option)][=(describe-function transient-option)=]] and [[elisp:(describe-function transient-switch)][=(describe-function transient-option)=]]
   to see a full document of their slots and methods.

   If you need an argument with a space instead of the equal sign, use a space
   and force the infix to be an argument by setting =:class transient-option=.

   #+begin_src elisp :tangle transient-showcase.el :var _=print-args-prelude

     (transient-define-prefix ts-switches-and-arguments (arg)
       "A prefix with switch and argument examples."
       [["Arguments"
         ("-s" "switch" "--switch")
         ("-a" "argument" "--argument=")
         ("t" "toggle" "--toggle")
         ("v" "value" "--value=")]

        ["More Arguments"
         ("-f" "argument with forced class" "--forced-class " :class transient-option)
         ("I" "argument with inline" ("-i" "--inline-shortarg="))
         ("S" "inline shortarg switch" ("-n" "--inline-shortarg-switch"))]]

       ["Commands"
        ("w" "wave some" ts-wave)
        ("s" "show arguments" ts-suffix-print-args)]) ; use to analyze the switch values

     ;; (ts-switches-and-arguments)

   #+end_src

*** Argument and Infix Macros

   If you need to fine-tune a switch (boolean infix), use
   =transient-define-infix=.  Likewise, use =transient-define-argument= for
   fine-tuning an argument.  The class definitions can be used as a reference
   while the [[https://magit.vc/manual/transient/Suffix-Slots.html#Slots-of-transient_002dinfix][manual]] provides more explanation.

   #+begin_src elisp :tangle transient-showcase.el :var _=print-args-prelude

     (transient-define-infix ts--random-init-infix ()
       "Switch on and off"
       :argument "--switch"
       :shortarg "-s" ; will be used for :key when key is not set
       :description "switch"
       :init-value (lambda (obj)
                     (oset obj value
                           (eq 0 (random 2))))) ; write t with 50% probability

     (transient-define-prefix ts-maybe-on ()
       "A prefix with a randomly intializing switch."
       ["Arguments"
        (ts--random-init-infix)]
       ["Show Args"
        ("s" "show arguments" ts-suffix-print-args)])

     ;; (ts-maybe-on)
     ;; (ts-maybe-on)
     ;; ...
     ;; Run the command a few times to see the random initialization of `ts--random-init-infix'
     ;; It will only take more than ten tries for one in a thousand users.  Good luck.

   #+end_src

*** Choices

   Choices can be set for an argument.  The property API and
   =transient-define-argument= are equivalent for configuring choices.  You can
   either hardcode or generate choices.

   #+begin_src elisp :tangle transient-showcase.el :var _=print-args-prelude

     (transient-define-argument ts--animals-argument ()
       "Animal picker"
       :argument "--animals="
       ; :multi-value t ; multi-value can be set to --animals=fox,otter,kitten etc
       :class 'transient-option
       :choices '("fox" "kitten" "peregrine" "otter"))

     (transient-define-prefix ts-animal-choices ()
       "Prefix demonstrating selecting animals from choices."
       ["Arguments"
        ("-a" "--animals=" ts--animals-argument)]
       ["Show Args"
        ("s" "show arguments" ts-suffix-print-args)])

     ;; (ts-animal-choices)

   #+end_src

**** Choices shorthand in prefix definition

   Choices can also be defined in a shorthand form.  Use =:class
   'transient-option= if you need to force a different class to be used.

   #+begin_src elisp :tangle no :var _=print-args-prelude

     (transient-define-prefix ts-animal-choices-shorthand ()
       "Prefix demonstrating the shorthand style of defining choices."
       ["Arguments"
        ("-a" "Animal" "--animal=" :choices ("fox" "kitten" "peregrine" "otter"))]
       ["Show Args"
        ("s" "show arguments" ts-suffix-print-args)])

     ;; (ts-animal-choices-shorthand)

   #+end_src

*** Mutually Exclusive Switches

   An argument with =:class transient-switches= may be used if a set of
   switches is exclusive.  The key will likely /not/ match the short argument.
   Regex is used to tell the interface that you are entering one of the
   choices.  The selected choice will be inserted into =:argument-format=.  The
   =:argument-regexp= must be able to match any of the valid options.

   *The UX on mutually exclusive switches is a bit of a pain to discover.  You
   must repeatedly press =:key= in order to cycle through the options.*

   #+begin_src elisp :tangle transient-showcase.el :var  _=print-args-prelude

     (transient-define-argument ts--snowcone-flavor ()
       :description "Flavor of snowcone"
       :class 'transient-switches
       :key "f"
       :argument-format "--%s-snowcone"
       :argument-regexp "\\(--\\(grape\\|orange\\|cherry\\|lime\\)-snowcone\\)"
       :choices '("grape" "orange" "cherry" "lime"))

     (transient-define-prefix ts-exclusive-switches ()
       "Prefix demonstrating exclusive switches."
       :value '("--orange-snowcone")

       ["Arguments"
        (ts--snowcone-flavor)]
       ["Show Args"
        ("s" "show arguments" ts-suffix-print-args)])

     ;; (ts-exclusive-switches)

   #+end_src

*** Incompatible Switches

    If you need to prevent arguments in a group from being set simultaneously,
    you can set the prefix property =:incompatible= and a list of the long-style
    argument.

    Use a list of lists, where each sublist is the long argument style. Match
    the string completely, including use of ~=~ in both arguments and switches.

   #+begin_src elisp :tangle transient-showcase.el :var  _=print-args-prelude

     (transient-define-prefix ts-incompatible ()
       "Prefix demonstrating incompatible switches."
       ;; update your transient version if you experience #129 / #155
       :incompatible '(("--switch" "--value=")
                       ("--switch" "--toggle" "--flip")
                       ("--argument=" "--value=" "--special-arg="))

       ["Arguments"
        ("-s" "switch" "--switch")
        ("-t" "toggle" "--toggle")
        ("-f" "flip" "--flip")

        ("-a" "argument" "--argument=")
        ("v" "value" "--value=")
        ("C-a" "special arg" "--special-arg=")]

       ["Show Args"
        ("s" "show arguments" ts-suffix-print-args)])

     ;; (ts-incompatible)

   #+end_src

*** TODO Short Args

    *This section is incomplete.  Maybe Magit contains better answers.*

    Sometimes the =:shortarg= in a CLI doesn't exactly match the =:key:= and
    =:argument=, so it can be specified manually.

    The =:shortarg= concept could be used to help use man-pages or only for
    [[https://magit.vc/manual/transient.html#index-transient_002ddetect_002dkey_002dconflicts][transient-detect-key-conflicts]] but it's not clear what behavior it changes.

    Shortarg cannot be used for exclusion excluding other options (prefix
    =:incompatible=) or setting default values (prefix =:value=).

*** Choices from a function

    See =transient-infix-read= for actual code.  This method uses the prefix's
    history and then delecates to =completing-read= or
    =completing-read-multiple=.  The =:choices= key coresponds to the
    =COLLECTION= argument passed to completing reads.

    *Note*, using a function for completions can appear to require a daunting
    amount of behavior if you read the manul [[info:elisp#Programmed
    Completion][section on programmed completions]].  If you however just return
    a list of options, even when FLAG is not t, everything seems just fine.

   #+begin_src elisp :tangle no :var  _=print-args-prelude

     (defun ts--animal-choices (complete-me predicate flag)
       ;; complete-me: whatever the user has typed so far
       ;; predicate: function you should use to filter candidates (only nil seen so far)
       ;; flag: request for metadata (which can be disrespected)

       ;; if you want to respect metadata requests, here's what the form might
       ;; look like, but no behavior was observed.
       (if (eq flag 'metadata)
           '(metadata . '((annotation-function . (lambda (c) "an annotation"))))

         ;; when not handling a metadata request from completions, use some
         ;; logic to generate the choices, possibly based on input or some time
         ;; / context sensitive process.  FLAG will be `t' when these are reqeusted.
         (if (eq 0 (random 2))
             '("fox" "kitten" "otter")
           '("ant" "peregrine" "zebra"))))

     (transient-define-prefix ts-choices-with-completions ()
       "Prefix with completions for choices."
       ["Arguments"
        ("-a" "Animal" "--animal="
         :always-read t ; don't allow unsetting, just read a new value
         :choices ts--animal-choices)]
       ["Show Args"
        ("s" "show arguments" ts-suffix-print-args)])

     ;; (ts-choices-with-completions)

   #+end_src

*** TODO multiple instances

    Switches and arguments that can be used multiple times are supported.
    Example needs to be written.  This is useful for CLI wrapping or perhaps
    situations where a command accepts multiple levels of the same setting.

** Dispatching args into a process

   If you want to call a command line application using the arguments, you might
   need to do a bit of work processing the arguments.  The following example
   uses cowsay.

   - Cowsay doesn't actually have a =message== argument, So we end up stripping
     it from the arguments and re-assembling something =call-process= can use.

   - Cowsay supports more options, but for the sake of keeping this example
     small (and to refocus effort on transient itself), the set of all CLI
     options are not fully supported.

   There's some errata about this example:

   - The predicates don't update the transient.  =(transient--redisplay)=
     doesn't do the trick.  We could use =transient--do-replace= and
     =transient-setup=, but that would lose existing state

   - The predicate needs to be exists & not empty (but doesn't matter yet)

  #+begin_src elisp :tangle transient-showcase.el

    (defun ts--quit-cowsay ()
      "Kill the cowsay buffer and exit"
      (interactive)
      (kill-buffer "*cowsay*"))

  At times, you need a prefix to show or hide certain options depending on the

** Visibility Predicates

   Simple [[https://magit.vc/manual/transient/Predicate-Slots.html#Predicate-Slots][predicates]] at the group or element level exist to hide parts of the
   transient when they wouldn't be useful at all in the situation.

** Inapt (Temporarily Unavailable)

   "Greyed out" suffixes.  Inapt is better if an option is temporarily
   unavailable due to a state that varies with each invocation of the
   transient.

   Inapt predicates work on suffixes, but not on groups (which would have to
   modify every child).

   *Note*, like visibility predicates, =inapt-*= predicates do not take effect
   until the transient has it's layout fully redone.  Therefore this example
   uses a child transient and updates the scope.

   #+begin_src elisp :tangle transient-showcase.el :var _=print-args-prelude :var __=levels-prelude

     (defun ts--child-scope-p ()

     ;; (ts-inapt-parent)

   #+end_src

***  TODO Documentation in manual missing

    There is not a single mention of inapt even though it's fully implemented
    and works.

** Levels

   Levels are another way to control visibility.

   - As a developer, you set levels to optionally expose or hide children in a
     prefix.
   - As a user, you change the prefix's level and the levels of suffixes to
     customize what's visible in the transient.

   *Lower levels are more visible. Setting the level higher reveals more
   suffixes.*   1-7 are valid levels.

   The user can adjust levels within a transient prefix by using (*C-x l*) for
   =transient-set-level=.  The default active level is 4, stored in
   =transient-default-level=.  The default level for children is 1, stored in
   =transient--default-child-level=.

   Per-suffix and per-group, the user can set the level at which the child will
   be visible.  Each prefix has an active level, remembered per prefix.  If the
   child level is less-than-or-equal to the child level, the child is visible.

   A hidden group will hide a suffix even if that suffix is at a low enough
   level.  Issue #153 has some addional information about behavior that might
   get cleaned up.

**** Defining group & suffix levels

   Adding default levels for children is as simple as adding integers at the
   beginning of each list or vector.  If some commands are not likely to be
   used, instead of making the hard choice to include them or not, you can
   provide them, but tell the user in your README to set higher levels.

     #+begin_src elisp :tangle transient-showcase.el :var _=levels-prelude :var _=show-level-prelude

       (transient-define-prefix ts-levels-and-visibility ()
         "Prefix with visibility levels for hiding rarely used commands."

             ("we" "wave eventually" ts--wave-eventually)]])

       ;; (ts-levels-and-visibility)

   #+end_src

**** Using the Levels UI

   Press (*C-x l*) to open the levels UI for the user.  Press (*C-x l*) again to
   change the active level.  Press a key such as "we" to change the level for a
   child.  After you cancel level editing with (*C-g*), you will see that children
   have either become visible or invisible depending on the changes you made.

   *While a child may be visible according to its own level, if it's hidden
   within the group, the user's level-setting UI for the prefix will contradict
   what's actually visible.  The UI does not allow setting group levels.*

  The previous sections are designed to go breadth-first so that you can get
  core ideas first. The following examples expand on combinations of several
  ideas or subclassing & customizing rarely used slots.

  Some of these examples are approaching the complexity of just reading [[elisp:(find-library "magit")][magit source]].

** Dynamically generating layouts

   While you can cover many cases using predicates, layouts, and visibility,
   *sometimes you really do want to generate a list of commands.*

   *Note*, beware that you could be creating a lot of suffix objects if the
   forms you use generate unique symbols.  These will pollute command
   completions over time, so probably don't do that.

   [[https://magit.vc/manual/transient.html#index-transient_002dsetup_002dchildren][transient-setup-children]]

   This is a group method that can be overridden in order to modify or eliminate
   some children from display.  If you need a central place for children to
   coordinate some behavior, this may work for you.

   #+begin_src elisp :tangle transient-showcase.el

     (transient-define-prefix ts-generated-child ()
       "Prefix that uses `setup-children' to generate single child."

       ["Replace this child"
        ;; Let's override the group's method
        :setup-children
        (lambda (_) ; we don't care about the stupid suffix

          ;; remember to return a list
          (list (transient-parse-suffix
                 transient--prefix
                 '("r" "replacement" (lambda ()
                                       (interactive)
                                       (message "okay!"))))))

        ("s" "haha stupid suffix" (lambda ()
                                    (interactive)
                                    (message "You should replace me!")))])

     ;; (ts-generated-child)

   #+end_src

   =transient--parse-child= takes the same configuration format as
   =transient-define-prefix=.  You can see the layout format in the [[id:49cb2ea4-66fa-4bc4-ab91-268580e907a5][layout
   hacking appendix]].  =transient--prarse-group= works almost exactly the
   same, just for groups.

   The same thing, but parsing an entire group spec:

   #+begin_src elisp :tangle no

     (transient-define-prefix ts-generated-group ()
       "Prefix that uses `setup-children' to generate a group."

       ["Replace this child"
        ;; Let's override the group's method
        :setup-children
        (lambda (_) ; we don't care about the stupid suffix

          ;; the result of parsing here will be a group
          (transient-parse-suffixes
           transient--prefix
           ["Group Name" ("r" "replacement" (lambda ()
                                              (interactive)
                                              (message "okay!")))]))

        ("s" "haha stupid suffix" (lambda ()
                                    (interactive)
                                    (message "You should replace me!")))])

     ;; (ts-generated-group)

   #+end_src

   If you need to define a dynamic group class, override
   =transient-setup-children=.  It will work almost entirely the same as the
   examples above.  Set your group class in the prefix using the =:class= key.

   *Note* you don't need to be inside of a layout body to hack around with
   dynamic layouts.  Mess around in [[elisp:(ielm))][ielm]].

   #+begin_src elisp :tangle no :results replace

     (transient--parse-child 'magit-dispatch '("a" "action" (lambda () (interactive) (message "hey"))))

   #+end_src

   *Note* you can replace =transient--prefix= with =ts-generated-group= in the
   example above.  =transient--prefix= is just a variable that happens to hold
   the prefix during layout.

*** TODO Correction in manual

    - These functions do mostly the same job.  Why do we need to specify a
      prefix for =transient-parse-suffixes=, for scope etc?

** Using prefix scope in children

   Basically you are on your own.  Just call =(oref transient--prefix scope)=
   during layout setup or =(oref transient-current-prefix)= during suffix
   bodies.

*** Obtaining Missing Scope

    Because suffixes are basically also commands (riding in the same symbol
    plist), a suffix can be called independently.  In this case, if its expecting
    to read the scope from the prefix when there is no prefix, it might fail.

    Therefore, a method called =transient-init-scope= can be overridden and used
    at the correct point in the lifecycle for the suffix to correct the issue.

    *Note*, the behavior is actually quite ad-hoc.  You will read the prefix
    yourself and then decide if you want to use some fallback.

    There is a perfectly short example in [[https://github.com/magit/magit/blob/40fb3d20026139ad1c3a3d9069b40d7d61bf8786/lisp/magit-transient.el#L56-L61][Magit source]] for the custom
    =magit--git-variable= subclass of the =transient-variable= infix.

    Each infix instance is declared in =transient-define-infix=, potentially with
    a =:scope= slot, possibly holding a function.

    If it's holding a function, that function will be used as a backup during
    initialization in case there is no prefix or it has nothing in its =scope=
    slot.

** Custom Infix Types
   :PROPERTIES:
   :ID:       0c3f2271-98e0-4db4-b95b-e31975bcbb5e
   :END:

   Not everything is a string or boolean.  You may want to represent complex
   objects in your transint infixes.  If your objects can be rehydrated from
   some serialized ID, you may want history support.

   If you need to set and display a custom type, use the simple OOP techniques
   of [[*EIEIO][EIEIO]].  Also check the [[info:transient#Suffix Value Methods][suffix value methods]] section of the transient
   manual.

   *Essential behaviors for your custom infix:*

   - Defining a reader to set the infix with user input
   - =prompt= slot's default form, =initform= for asking the user for input
   - =transient-init-value= to rehydrate saved values
   - =transient-infix-value= so that setting & saving persist what you want to rehydrate
   - =transient-format-value= to display a user-meaningful form for your value

   We will also use some layout introspection:

   - =transient-get-suffix= To get suffix by *key*, *location*, or *command symbol*
   - Getting a description from raw layout children (not EIEIO objects).  See
     [[id:49cb2ea4-66fa-4bc4-ab91-268580e907a5][Layout Hacking]].

    #+end_src

    This is a difficult example, but once you understand the pieces, you can
    see some of the magit variables in action like =magit--git-variable= and
    it's many subclasses.

    Revisit the section on [[id:6f6c8eba-1c0e-41c4-b57f-c06ab00f64d1][detangling setting, saving and
    history]].  Watching the values update will make it clear what
    representations are bing stored, where, and when.

*** Reading custom infix values

    *Note*, however you store and rehydrate will affect how you read, so try to
    make it just work with =transient-read-arg=, unlike this example (TODO).

    Modifying the very outer group doesn't quite work.  It's probably a
    degenrate layout object, meaning setting a description doesn't cause it to
    behave like a group with a heading.  Maybe outer groups have a different
    data structure?  *An exercise left to the reader*

    The flow control for re-display is slightly fighting the history
    implementation.  It would be better if we could retain values while
    triggering a redraw without even more hacking & state manipulation.

** EIEIO - OOP in Elisp

    Emacs lisp ships with eieio, a close cousin to the Common Lisp Object
    System.  It's OOP.  There are classes & subclasses.  You can inherit into new
    classes and override methods to customize behaviors.

    You can use eieio API's to explore transient objects.  Let's look at some
    transients you have already:

    #+begin_src elisp :tangle no :results replace

      ;; The plist for a prefix command contains a `transient-prefix' object in the
      ;; `transient--prefix' key and a vector layout in `transient--layout' (symbol-plist
      (symbol-plist 'magit-dispatch)

      ;; getting the values from the symbol plist
      (plist-get (symbol-plist 'magit-dispatch) 'transient--prefix)

      (let ((prefix-object (plist-get (symbol-plist 'magit-dispatch) 'transient--prefix)))

        ;; printing the current slot values for that object
        (object-write prefix-object)

        ;; ;; Object transient-prefix-20997da
        ;; (transient-prefix "transient-prefix-20997da"
        ;;   :command magit-dispatch  :info-manual "(magit)Top")

        ;; getting the class of an object
        (eieio-object-class prefix-object) ; transient-prefix

        ;; opening the help documents for the class, which shows all methods and
        ;; slot forms
        (describe-function transient-prefix))

    #+end_src

*** Typical OOP

    Like all OOP, the three things you want to do are:

**** Override methods

     =cl-defmethod= and sometimes =cl-call-next-method=

**** Override default values

     Inside the =defclass= form, you can set slots that you don't like.
     =:initform= is a default value.  =:initarg= configures which argument
     to pick up from the class constructor.

**** Read & Update

     =oref= and =oset=

**** Call Methods

     =(method-name object arguments)=

**** Introspection

     See methods like =slot-boundp= in the EIEIO [[info:eieio#Function Index][eieio method index]]

*** Transient's defclass's and their inheritance

    Here's a list of all of transient's =defclass= and their ancestry.  This is
    how it is in 2022.

    #+begin_src elisp :tangle no :results replace

      (eieio-browse) ; shows all known classes and their ancestry

      ;;          +--magit-diff-prefix
      ;;               +--magit-diff-refresh-prefix

    #+end_src

*** View Class Methods and Attributes

    Using =describe-function= is extremely handly for viewing the class slots
    and methods.

    Classes used in transient that you are likely to want to know the slots for:

    [[elisp:(describe-function 'transient-prefix)][transient-prefix]]
    [[elisp:(describe-function 'transient-suffix)][transient-suffix]]
    [[elisp:(describe-function 'transient-infix)][transient-infix]]
    [[elisp:(describe-function 'transient-argument)][transient-argument]]

    [[https://www.gnu.org/software/emacs/manual/html_mono/eieio.html#Inheritance][The eieio docs]] have a more wordy treatment.  The class system has a lot of
    behavior that can be faster at times to just understand through description.

** Debugging

   There is a lot of support for both print-line and step-through debugging.

*** Print debug messages

    Just set =transient--debug= to t.  [[elisp:(setq transient--debug t)][(setq transient-debug t)]]

    You will get a lot of logs visible in =*Messages*= via
    [[elisp:(view-echo-message-area)][view-echo-message-area]] the next time you run a transient.

    #+begin_src text :eval never

    -- setup              (cmd: ts-layout-rows-explicit, event: "M-x", exit: nil)
    -- stack-zap          (cmd: ts-layout-rows-explicit, event: "M-x", exit: nil)
    -- init-transient     (cmd: ts-layout-rows-explicit, event: "M-x", exit: nil)
         push transient--transient-map
         push transient--redisplay-map
    -- post-command       (cmd: ts-layout-rows-explicit, event: "M-x", exit: nil)
    -- pre-command        (cmd: transient-update, event: "w", exit: nil)

    -- pre-exit           (cmd: ts-suffix-wave, event: "w l", exit: t)
         pop  transient--transient-map

    -- post-exit          (cmd: ts-suffix-wave, event: "w l", exit: t)

    #+end_src

*** Watching evaluation in Edebug

    *Edebug works with transients.  There is much support in transient to
    facilitate using edebug.*

    For watching the flow control around your command, especially helpful for
    debugging behavior around setup, layout, or suffix dispatch, you might want
    to watch your transient in Edebug.

    [[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=odkYXXYOxpo][Edebug]] basic introduction video (10 min).

    In short:

    - goto your [[elisp:(find-library "transient")][transient source]]
    - instrument a function you want to watch with =edebug-defun=
    - call the transient / suffix that triggers entry of that function
    - use =SPC= to step forward, =c= to continue, =i= to enter a function call,
      or =h= for help etc

    First watch the debug output to gain an idea of how your code flows with the
    transient code.  Then instrument transient behaviors such as
    =transient--post-exit= and use =i= to =edebug-step-in= to calls of interest.

    When you are done, remember to use [[elisp:(edebug-remove-instrumentation)][=edebug-remove-instrumentation=]] so that
    you can go on without every transient you open trying to call the debugger.

**** Debugging Macro Forms

    Because edebug works on defuns while suffixes are defined with macros, you
    may need to macro exand in order to come up with something debuggable.

** Layout Hacking
   :PROPERTIES:
   :ID:       49cb2ea4-66fa-4bc4-ab91-268580e907a5
   :END:

    First you need to explort the layout data structures.

    #+begin_src elisp :tangle no :results replace

      ;; Let's look at the layout
      (let ((prefix-layout (plist-get (symbol-plist 'magit-dispatch) 'transient--layout)))

        (type-of prefix-layout) ; cons

        (listp prefix-layout) ; t

        (length prefix-layout) ; 3

        ;; Each group in the list is a vector
        (vectorp (car prefix-layout)) ; t

        (elt (car prefix-layout) 0) ; first element is a priority
        (elt (car prefix-layout) 1) ; second is a type name
        (elt (car prefix-layout) 2) ; contents & attributes

        ;; the attributes are key-value pairs used to create the class
        ;; instance when the transient is shown.

        ;; the nested contents will be lists of vectors for groups and
        ;; lists of lists for suffixes.

        )

      ;; A sample layout

      ;; ([1 transient-column nil
      ;;     ((1 transient-suffix
      ;;         (:key "i" :description "Ignore" :command magit-gitignore))
      ;;      (1 transient-suffix
      ;;         (:key "I" :description "Init" :command magit-init))
      ;;      (1 transient-suffix
      ;;         (:key "j" :description "Jump to section" :command magit-status-jump :if-mode magit-status-mode))
      ;;      (1 transient-suffix
      ;;         (:key "j" :description "Display status" :command magit-status-quick :if-not-mode magit-status-mode)))])

    #+end_src

    You might find this helpful when constructing [[*Dynamic Layouts][dynamic layouts]]

** Hooks

   Just a reminder, some hooks exist.  Use =describe-variable= and complete with
   =transient hook= for the most recent list of hooks.

** Preludes

   Definitions that are not that interesting on their own but are used in examples.

*** ts-suffix-wave Command

   #+name: wave-prelude

     (defun ts-suffix-wave ()

   #+end_src

*** ts--define-waver

     ;; Because command names are used to store and lookup child levels, we have

     (ts--define-waver "eventually")
     (ts--define-waver "hidden")

     #+end_src

*** ts-suffix-print-args

   Here's a suffix that reads the transient's infix values, the prefix's
   scope, and any universal argument (=C-u 4= etc).

   #+name: print-args-prelude
   #+begin_src elisp :tangle no

     (transient-define-suffix ts-suffix-print-args (prefix-arg)
       "Report the universal argument, prefix's scope, and infix values."
       :transient 'transient--do-call
       (interactive "P")
       (let ((args (transient-args (oref transient-current-prefix command)))
             (scope (oref transient-current-prefix scope)))
         (message "prefix-arg: %s \nprefix's scope value: %s \ntransient-args: %s"
                  prefix-arg scope args)))

   #+end_src

** Essential Elisp

   If you were hit in the face with the first example, you need to learn basic
   Elisp.  This is not an Elisp guide.  Here's some starting points:

  - [[info:elisp#Macros][transient-define-prefix]] is a macro that creates a command and attaches a
    =transient-prefix= object to the command symbol's plist.
  - [[info:elisp#Lambda][lambda]] is a macro to create an anonymous function
  - [[info:elisp#Using Interactive][interactive]] is a macro that makes the function compatible with the command
    interface, the =M-x= or =execute-extended-command= menu
  - [[info:elisp#Vector Functions][The brackets]] are just vector syntax.

    Besides the other ways to evaluate elisp used in this README, try =ielm=.

    Use the built-in elisp manual by calling the command =elisp-index-search=.
    See shortdocs for functions using =shortdoc-display-groups=.

    The EIEIO and CL manuals are independent from the Elisp manual for some
    reason.  EIEIO is pretty short and not used much once you get the hang of
    it. =info-display-manual=

    [[info:cl#Top][Common Lisp manual]] you don't really need the common lisp manual for working
    with transient.  Don't be alarmed when you see EIEIO using functions like
    =cl-call-next-method=

* Further Reading

  - [[info:transient#Top][*The Transient Manual*]] ([[https://magit.vc/manual/transient.html][web link]]) contains more detailed explanation of behavior.  The examples
    here should allow you to visualize what is being described.  This guide and
    the manual should be your first and second sources.

  - [[elisp:(find-library "transient")][*Transient source*]] ([[https://github.com/magit/transient/blob/master/lisp/transient.el][web link]]) is all in one file.  Source code is always
    more accurate than manual descriptions, even if some behavior
    implementations are a bit scattered.

  - [[elisp:(find-library "magit")][*Magit source*]] ([[https://github.com/magit/magit/search?q=transient][web link]]) contains numerous examples of transient being used in a big,
    full-feature application.  Search the source for "transient" and you will
    find many prefixes, suffixes, and custom classes.  The smallest examples may
    be harder to find and most combine many behaviors at once.
